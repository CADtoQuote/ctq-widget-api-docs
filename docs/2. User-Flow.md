Cost differences (shown in brackets) are only supported for materials.

Following parameters will only be available if the model is sliced at least once ([PATCH /orders/{order_id}](../reference/ctq-widget-api.v1.yaml/paths/~1orders~1%7Border_id%7D/patch) request with ```process_id```, ```material_id``` and ```quality_id``` has been sent):
- model size
- model thumbnails
- material cost differences
- any of the settings selected (```process_id```, ```material_id```, ```quality_id```, ```color_id```, ```postproduction_id```)

### Update order - slicing for the first time

[PATCH /orders/{order_id}](../reference/ctq-widget-api.v1.yaml/paths/~1orders~1%7Border_id%7D/patch)

Used after successful upload of the model. 

```process_id```, ```material_id``` and ```quality_id```
are required for the first time slicing. These parameters can be obtained from ```default_settings``` (retrieved in [GET /info](../reference/ctq-widget-api.v1.yaml/paths/~1info/get))

### Update order - configuring parts

[PATCH /orders/{order_id}](../reference/ctq-widget-api.v1.yaml/paths/~1orders~1%7Border_id%7D/patch)

Every change in configuration is done by sending PATCH request. 

**Example**: Request body for item quantity change:
```{
  "items": [
    {
    "id": "item_id",
    "quantity": 2
    }     
  ]
}
```

*Apply settings to all* is done by sending PATCH request with all items (with the same settings) included in the body.
